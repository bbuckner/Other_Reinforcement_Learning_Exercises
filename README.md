The files in this repo contain various reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that I used to solve some classic RL tasks.<br>  These exercises served as my introduction to RL and follow the book 'Reinforcement Learning, An Introduction' by Sutton and Barto.  Having a thorough understanding of the basics helps when trying to understand why some of the more complicated RL algorithms like PPO and DDPG work.
