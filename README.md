# Reinforcement-Learning-Projects

The projects in this folder are my attempts at implementing reinforcement learning concepts described in the textbook 
Reinforcment Learning, An Introduction (second edition) by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto, as well as
the The University of Alberta Reinforcement Learning specialization course on coursera.
No psudocode or actual code was given.  All code done in these projects was done from scratch based on my understanding of the concepts.
