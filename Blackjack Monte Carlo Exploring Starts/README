I uploaded the iterations of the code from the first time I sat down at the computer to the final version and all iterations in between.
This is to provide insight into how I think and organize/re-factor my code while working on a project.
All these iterations were done in one sitting but I wanted to save my progress after each major implementation before re-factoring the code so I didnt lose anything.
